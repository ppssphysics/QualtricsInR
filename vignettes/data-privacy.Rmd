In the context of the recent GDPR regulation, one important set of functions provided by the 
Qualtrics API are the data privacy functions. You can:

1. Create an erasure request
2. List your erasure requests
3. Retrieve a given erasure request

**To use this call you must be a Qualtrics brand administrator.**

## Create an erasure request

You must provide a list of customer emails to be deleted. We overwrite the default Qualtrics parameter
`searh_only = FALSE` with a TRUE value. This allows to execute the request as a dry run and not delete an
entities. Use FALSE to delete the entities from your QWualtrics account.

When processed, the request will search for any entities within Qualtrics that match 
any of the supplied emails; these entities include 

- Users 
- MailingList & XM Directory contacts 
- People 
For any entity discovered the service will erase any responses to surveys they have submitted, along with any tickets that may have
originated from their responses before erasing the entity itself.

```
# Create a dry run erasure request
create_erasure_request(list("john.doe@alabama.com", "maria.doe@alabama.com"))
# Create a erasure request
create_erasure_request(list("john.doe@alabama.com"), FALSE)
```

## List and retrieve erasure requests

You can list all erasure requests performed by the brand.

```
list_erasing_requests()
```

This allows you to use the id of a given erasure request to retrieve that request

```
get_erasing_request("OP-a2c24e5e-d4b1-4bd8-a9e8-9a1c8520c8d2")
```

Note that a given erasure request can only be retrieve one that request has been 
fully processed by Qualtrics. This means that until the status available from the
`list_erasing_requests` appears as *Completed*, the `get_erasing_request`
will return an error.
